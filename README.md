🧩⛓️ Fair On-Chain Puzzle: A Beginner's Dive into Solidity

Ever wondered how to build a "fair" game on a system where everyone can see all the data? Welcome to your first and most important lesson in blockchain development!

This project isn't just a simple "memory game." It's a hands-on exploration of blockchain transparency and how to create provable fairness in a "trustless" environment.

🤯 The "Aha!" Moment: Blockchain is Public!

In a normal game, you'd hide the card locations on a server. You can't do that on a blockchain.

All contract data, even private variables, is visible to anyone who knows how to look. So, a traditional "memory" game is impossible! A player could simply read the contract's storage and solve the puzzle instantly.

This isn't a bug; it's the core feature of a public ledger. Our "puzzle" embraces this.

🎯 The Real Challenge: Provable Fairness

If the solution is public, where's the game? The "fairness" comes from the board's creation.

This contract uses a pseudo-random shuffle (Fisher-Yates) to generate a unique, unpredictable 16-card board for every player. The "game" is to correctly interact with the contract to "match" the pairs, and the "fairness" is the guarantee that the board was shuffled in a way the player couldn't predict.

✨ Features

🎲 Fair-ish Shuffle: Creates a unique game board using a keccak256 hash of block data and a user-provided salt.

🔐 On-Chain State: Manages the entire game state—board, matched pairs, and turn logic—directly on the blockchain.

🔄 Clean Turn Logic: Smartly tracks the 1st and 2nd card flips, checking for matches or non-matches.

🏆 Win & Cleanup: Automatically detects the 8-pair win condition and deletes the game state to give the player a gas refund.

📡 Rich Events: Emits detailed events (GameStarted, Flip, MatchFound, GameWon) so a web app can easily listen and update its UI.

🎮 How to Play (Right in Remix!)

Open in Remix: Click here to load the contract!

Compile: Go to the "Solidity compiler" tab (second from top) and click Compile SimpleMemoryPuzzle.sol.

Deploy:

Go to the "Deploy & run transactions" tab (third from top).

Next to the orange "Deploy" button, enter a random number (e.g., 123) for the _salt.

Click Deploy. Your contract is now live on a test blockchain!

Play:

Scroll down to "Deployed Contracts" to find your game.

Call flipCard(uint8 _index) with a number from 0 to 15.

Call flipCard again with a different index.

Check the transaction logs to see if you got a MatchFound or NoMatch event!

Keep matching until you see the GameWon event!

Peek (The "Cheat"): Call the getBoard function to see the full, shuffled board array. This proves the data is public!

🚀 Your Next Mission

This contract is the "engine." Now, why not build the "car"?

Build a Frontend: Create a simple React, Vue, or Svelte web app that connects to this contract (using ethers.js or web3.js) and provides a real visual grid of cards for users to click.

Upgrade to True Randomness: The shuffle here is "fair-ish" but still predictable by miners. For a high-stakes game, you'd upgrade the shuffle to use a Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function), which is the industry standard for secure on-chain randomness.

⚠️ The Fine Print (Disclaimer)

This contract is for educational purposes only. The pseudo-randomness used is NOT secure for any application involving real money (like gambling). It is vulnerable to miner exploitation and other on-chain prediction attacks. Always use a proper Oracle like Chainlink VRF for production-ready randomness.
