/**
 * @title SimpleMemoryPuzzle
 * @author You
 * @notice A simple, on-chain "puzzle" contract for beginners.
 *
 * --- !! IMPORTANT BEGINNER CONCEPT: Public Data !! ---
 *
 * This contract demonstrates a "puzzle" but NOT a "memory" game in
 * the traditional sense.
 *
 * On a public blockchain like Ethereum, *all* contract data is PUBLIC.
 * Even `private` variables can be read by off-chain tools.
 *
 * This means our `board` array, once created, can be seen by anyone.
 * A player doesn't need "memory" â€“ they can just read the board
 * from the contract and solve the puzzle.
 *
 * --- !! HOW WE CREATE "FAIRNESS" !! ---
 *
 * The "fairness" comes from the board's *generation*. We use a
 * pseudo-random shuffle based on block data and a user-provided `_salt`.
 * This shuffle is "fair-ish" because it's difficult for a player
 * or miner to predict the outcome.
 *
 * A *truly* fair and unpredictable shuffle would require an
 * "Oracle" (like Chainlink VRF), which is a more advanced topic.
 *
 * This contract is a great starting point to learn about state,
 * structs, mappings, and the fundamental limitations of the EVM.
